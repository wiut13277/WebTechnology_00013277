This site was created as an online sales site for Caffeine Cafe located in Tashkent. Caffeine Cafe has been operating for many years. I have created specific sites for their products on this site, each with detailed information about each product. I was helped to create this site by Caffeine Cafe's own site. (http://caffeine.uz/). I have had some difficulties while creating this site. This is because some products did not have pictures, or there was almost no information about them. To solve this problem, I visited this cafe and got answers to my questions and some pictures.

While doing this project, I asked myself, "Why exactly Caffeine, other cafes, or famous places. Why this place?". My answer to this question is that this place has been growing fast lately and has high ratings for its food. I think their personal websites are designed in a simple way. The reason is that this site focuses only on the home page. The rest of the pages are almost untouched. I relayed this information to the caffeine workers as well.

Writing codes is not as easy as I thought. The reason is that it is necessary to pay serious attention to the details of each part of the site. While working on the project, there were dreams that maybe I had chosen this direction in vain and that I would give it up. The reason is that there are errors in the codes I write, and it took a lot of time and energy to solve them until I did everything shown on the Internet. I now understand programmers' plight while creating a real program or site. All site codes were written in Visual Studio Core. Pictures and information as I said before are taken from Caffeine's site or from Caffeine's staff.
